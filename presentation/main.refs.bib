  abstract  = "Utilizing cumulative correlation information already existing in
               an evolutionary process, this paper proposes a predictive
               approach to the reproduction mechanism of new individuals for
               differential evolution (DE) algorithms. DE uses a distributed
               model (DM) to generate new individuals, which is relatively
               explorative, whilst evolution strategy (ES) uses a centralized
               model (CM) to generate offspring, which through adaptation
               retains a convergence momentum. This paper adopts a key feature
               in the CM of a covariance matrix adaptation ES, the cumulatively
               learned evolution path (EP), to formulate a new evolutionary
               algorithm (EA) framework, termed DEEP, standing for DE with an
               EP. Without mechanistically combining two CM and DM based
               algorithms together, the DEEP framework offers advantages of
               both a DM and a CM and hence substantially enhances performance.
               Under this architecture, a self-adaptation mechanism can be
               built inherently in a DEEP algorithm, easing the task of
               predetermining algorithm control parameters. Two DEEP variants
               are developed and illustrated in the paper. Experiments on the
               CEC'13 test suites and two practical problems demonstrate that
               the DEEP algorithms offer promising results, compared with the
               original DEs and other relevant state-of-the-art EAs.",
